# AstroText ðŸš€ | Chrome Extension

**Author:** Pablo Beltran <br>
**Version:** v1.0.0 <br>
**Release Data:** May 12th, 2025 <br>

## What is AstroText ðŸš€?

AstroText is a lightweight Chrome extension that enhances and improves user-written text using a Large Language Model (LLM) API, such as OpenAI's GPT. It focuses on grammar correction, lexical improvements, and tone adjustment to support both non-native and native English speakersâ€”especially in contexts like social media posts or professional emails.

## Core Features

### LLM API Integration

- Users can connect their own API key through the settings modal
- API key is stored securely in Chrome's sync storage
- Toggle visibility of API key with an eye icon
- Changes to API key are only saved when explicitly confirmed

### Tone Selection

- Choose the desired tone: Original, Formal, or Playful
- Tone selection affects the style of the generated text
- Changes are applied immediately to new generations

### Improve Readability Toggle

- **When ON:** rewrites the paragraph to improve flow and clarity
- **When OFF:** only performs grammar and lexical corrections
- Toggle state is visually indicated with a red checkbox
- Changes are applied immediately to new generations

### Text Editor

- A text area where the user pastes or writes the paragraph to be improved
- Supports both input and output modes
- Automatically switches to input mode when editing
- Maintains original text for comparison

### Action Buttons

- **Clear:** Clears the current text and resets the editor state
- **Copy:** Copies the currently displayed text (input or output) to the clipboard
- **Compare:** Toggles between original and generated text for easy comparison
    - Shows tooltip indicating which text will be displayed
    - Makes textarea read-only during comparison
    - Visual indicator when in compare mode
- **Generate:** Sends the text to the LLM for processing
    - Disabled when no API key is set or text is empty
    - Shows loading state during generation

### Settings Modal

- Opens a secondary modal to configure and store the API Key
- Secure password field with visibility toggle
- Save button is disabled when no changes are made
- Cancel button reverts any unsaved changes
- API key is never sent to our servers

### AI Trace Avoidance

- The output must not use the character "â€”" (em dash), as it's often a giveaway of AI-generated text
- Maintains natural language patterns in generated text

## UI Layout

A minimal, rounded modal with a vertical stack layout:
